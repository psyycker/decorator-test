# Experimentation of the decorator in JS
This repo is just some understanding about the decorators in JS.

## Build and run
Run the command
```shell script
    npm install && npm start
```

The expected output is
```text
    arguments:  []
    woof
    result:  undefined
    
    
    
    arguments:  [ 'hello wo.. Woof!' ]
    hello wo.. Woof!
    result:  The dog said hello wo.. Woof!
```

Have a look into the `index.js` and the `src` folder for more information
